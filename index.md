The weather was good on the morning of **August 6, 1945**. The equipment functioned perfectly, and no harm came to the American crew passing over Hiroshima that day. The bomb performed exactly as planned.

Warning radar had detected some activity in the south of Japan, but because there were so few planes and they flew at such high altitude, the warning was lifted in the city. At **8:15**, Kaleria Palchikoff Drago, then living in Ushita, a suburb of the city, saw a blinding flash of light over the city, and then it was gone. _“There was a city, and then no city. You could see the ocean. And right after that, black rain. And that’s when the fire started,”_ Palchikoff would later remember. [^first]

All communications from Hiroshima ceased, and the men at military headquarters in Tokyo were puzzled, hearing conflicting reports from nearby towns of a large explosion. This impossible; there were no large stores of explosives, and there was no indication of a large enemy raid. Even when the disaster was officially confirmed, Japanese officials did not know what had actually occurred until the White House released a statement sixteen hours later.  [^second]

It is difficult to estimate the total number of casualties, however the best available figures from the Manhattan Engineer District estimate that of Hiroshima’s population of **255,000**, **66,000**  were killed and **69,000** injured. Sixty percent of the immediate deaths were caused by burns. [^second]

Months after the blast, in the only interview of witnesses in Japan conducted in English, Palchikoff told members of the Morale Division of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey:  

_People started coming out, some bruised, some wounded, and some burned…. The skin just peel[ed] off. Some of them you could see the bone. The eyes were closed, the nose bled, and the lips swelled, and the whole head started swelling. And as soon as they gave water to them, they’d vomit it all out and they’d keep on vomiting until they die. Blood would rush out, and that was the end of them. On the second day, the wounds became yellow in color, and the wounds would go deeper and deeper. No matter how much you’d try to take off the yellow rotten flesh they’d just go deeper and deeper._ [^first]

On August 15, 1945, Emperor Hirohito agreed to the country’s surrender. He formally signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on September 2, 1945.
